This is where the audio project will come to fruition 

**Proposal**

For this audio project I want to create a fictional piece that tells a mostly silent yet emmersive story. The story will take place in some type of peaceful meadow, situated near some trickling water source, and will feature somewhat fairytale like sounds like soft music and the sound of butterfly wings. The audio story will start out with someone just casually relaxing in the meadow, probably reading a book, when all of a sudden they hear a nois (something running past them) in the distance. They will then get up to investigate the noise, muttering quietly to themselves and then come across some type of food which they will proceed to eat and then enter a state of delirium. The idea for this is not necessarily unique since I was mostly inspired by Alice in Wonderland, but I think it will be a cool way to play around with sound to create an emerisive audio experience for the listener. Here is my asset list
